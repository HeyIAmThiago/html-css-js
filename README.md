# HTML-CSS-JS Projects

Welcome to my collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects! In here, I'm gonna post my HTML, CSS, and VanillaJS studies. Most of my posts in here are YouTube/Udemy/Discord challenges, so I didn't create the UI of 99% of the projects. 

These projects are for educational purposes, where I practice cloning interfaces to improve my skills.
